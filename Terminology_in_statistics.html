    <p>As I begin my long adventure as a middle-age father of a toddler who is attempting to learn statistics, I’ll update this page until it becomes too unwieldy and awkward to use, then I’ll hopefully consider a more organised approach.

<h3>Statistic Types</h3>
<ul>
<li>Descriptive Statistics - This branch of statistics is reporting values and averages on actual observations recorded</li>
<li>Inferential Statistics - This branch of statistics is used to find relationships between multiple variables. Often used in insurance and gambling for example</li>
</ul>
<h3>Variable Types</h3>
<p>There are two types of variables, categorical and numerical. Categorical variables are known as <strong>qualitative variables</strong> will normally group data together, Numerical variables, known as <strong>quantitive variables</strong> tells you how many or how often something happens, they can be counted and aggregated.</p>
<h3>Qualitative Variable Subtypes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Nominal - Example is Male:Female, neither is greater than the other, and there is no order.</li>
<li>Ordinal - Example is Small:Medium:Large, there is a logical order to the groupings</li>
</ul>
<h3>Quantitive Variable Subtypes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Discrete - these are whole numbers, such as the number of people who entered the shop today</li>
<li>Continuous - these can be fractions, a persons age can be measured in years, months, days, hours, seconds, milliseconds.</li>
</ul>
<p><img alt="VariableTree" src="images/variables1.png"></p>
<h3>Level of Variable Measurement</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nominal</strong>
    Data can be classified/grouped, but cannot be placed into an order.</li>
<li><strong>Ordinal</strong>
    Data that can be placed into an order such as “small / medium/ Large”, ranking of A,B,C,D.</li>
<li><strong>Interval</strong>
    There are precise differences between observations, this can be temperature as an example IQ score. Interval measurements are missing a “true zero”. For example zero degrees temperature doesn’t mean there is no warmth/temperature. 20 degrees F is not twice as hot as 10 degrees F (because this measurement is actually the scale of energy in molecules, Kelvin is the measurement of temperature).</li>
<li><strong>Ratio</strong>
    Height, weight, area and number of occurances all come under ratio, and all have a true zero value. If you measure zero height, there is no height! If person 1 can lift 20kg and person 2 can lift 10kg, then person 1 can lift twice as much, a 2 to 1 ratio.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Dependent Variable</h3>
<p>These are variables that are impacted when other variables are changed. For example as the number of cargo boxes on a transport ship increases, so does the weight of the ship itself. The weight is the dependent variable. </p>
<h3>Independent Variable</h3>
<p>These variables are not affected when other variables change. For example the width of a building will remain the same, even though you build extra hight (additional floors) to the building</p>
<h3>Regression Analysis</h3>
<p>This is a statistical process for estimating the relationship among variables. The focus is on the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables</p>
<h3>Bivariate Data</h3>
<p>Compare two variables. These are often set out in a plot, where the X axis is set to the independent variable, and the Y axis is set to the dependent variable. </p>
<h3>Covariance</h3>
<p>This is the measure of of two (or more) data fluctuating in sync. There is a correlation. The further away the measurement is from zero, the strong the covariance.</p>
<p><span class="math">\(cov(X,Y)=\overset{1}{N}\Sigma\)</span>
<span class="math">\(cov(X,Y)=\overset{1}{N}\sum\limits_{i=1}(x_{i}-\bar{x})(y_i-\bar{y})\)</span>
<img alt="Covariance" src="images/Screenshot%202019-02-22%20at%2014.20.12.png"></p>
<h3>Under-coverage bias</h3>
<p>This is where you haven’t covered enough diverse sample. For example to stand out on your high street and ask who they will vote for in an election, and then assume that you can scale that up to represent the entire country.</p>
<h3>Self-selection bias</h3>
<p>If you pop up an optional survey on your website, there are certain types of people who will volunteer to fill it in, there are certain types of people who would never spend their time filling in the survey. So you now have a bias sample.</p>
<h3>Survivorship bias</h3>
<p>If you were doing an analysis piece on the stock market over the last X years, but you only included companies who have survived to present day, this is survivorship bias and should be avoided. You should look to include collapsed companies that were also on the stock market unless you have a specific reason not to.</p>
<h3>t-Test</h3>
<p>Independent Samples - This is testing the mean value of two different data sets
Paired Sample - Testing the mean value for the same dataset on different times. Perhaps you gather data for 2018, then gather the same data but in 2019 and compare the values to see the differences.
One Sample - tests the mean of a single group against a known mean. This known mean might be some fact or from other work someone else has previously done.</p>
<h3><em>Exponent / Logarithm</em></h3>
<p>These two math formula are often used to show the growth or recline of a quantity.
Exponent tells you the number of times you need to multiple a number by itself, in the example below 2<strong>2</strong>2*2 = 16<br>
<img alt="exponent1" src="images/exponent1.png"><img alt="log1" src="images/log1.png"><br>
The logarithm is reversing the operation. Using 2 as the base, and 16 as the final result what is the logarithm (or exponent) value needed to achieve that 16 result.</p>
<h3>More examples</h3>
<p><img alt="log2" src="images/log2.png">  </p>
<h3>Univariate distribution graphs</h3>
<p>1) Histogram – visualise one feature at one time
2) Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) is also very popular</p>
<h3>Bivariate distribution graphs</h3>
<p>1) Scatter Plot</p>
<h3><em>Skewness</em></h3>
<p>In a histogram a <strong>normal distribution</strong> is when the shape of the bell curve is (or nearly) equal on both sides. <strong>Right skewed</strong> is when there is a longer tail on the right, and <strong>left skewed</strong> is when there is a longer tail on the left side (and so a sharp falloff on the right). In a left skewed distribution the mean value will be smaller than the median value. In a right skewed distribution the mean value will be higher than the median value.</p>
